# Cobol Reporter
This project contains a few scripts for understanding COBOL code that I did for an interview.
It uses instructor and Pydantic to create a report about COBOL code. It embeds the GNU COBOL 2.0 Programmers manual using
llama-index and presents a chatbot-like interface for RAG.


The vector store is kept offline once you create the embeddings. I think you can just use my embeddings from this repo though and avoid the 20 cent charge.


Happy trails prospector :wink:
